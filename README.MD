## RELEVANT INTERESTS

I have been playing the piano for over 25 years as well as composing music as a hobby for about as long. There are many parallels to coding and music, mainly that they both take consistent practice, dedication and a passion for them, in order to excel. Also, they are both languages, and the way of thinking, especially in composition is very similar to that of coding. The gratification of solving a problem, seeing a concept come to fruition or achieving what you thought you could not are not mutually exclusive to either, but is the drive that keeps me passionate about them.
